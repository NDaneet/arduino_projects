# New Solenoid Lock Code
Modified the CameraWebServer example code for Esp32, to control solenoid lock through a relay connected to the camera. Modifications were also made to other files such as the app_httpd.cpp to prevent the camera from freezing as was the case with the original example file. The code was updated to the ESP32-CAM and utilized for its purpose.
