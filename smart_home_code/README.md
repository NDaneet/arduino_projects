# Smart Home Automation 

Source code for smart home automation. Here, the code was written by me to control appliances such as lights and fan over the internet by integrating with Firebase. Also to monitor data gotten from DHT-11 and PIR sensors. Everything was uploaded to NodeMCU and made to control the hardware components.
